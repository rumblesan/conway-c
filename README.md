# Conway C

## About

Nothing ground breaking, just Conway's game of life in C.

Graphics done with SDL, partial unit tests with Min Unit, coverage with Lcov and shoddy code by yours truly.

Still some features I want to add but this at least works and compiles. Click the screen to iterate the cells.
